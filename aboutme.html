                        I'm currently a sophomore at Rutgers University double majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I have an intense passion for learning and studying languages and I am very interested in the intersections between computer science and linguistics. 
                        I am currently delving into the fields of data science and machine learning at hackathons and side projects, but I am looking to expand my work into more specialized fields like natural language processing and computational linguistics.

                        When I'm not programming, I am an active cellist and an avid classical music fan. Some of my favorite composers include Mahler, Rachmaninoff, and Shostakovich, to name a few. 
                        I also enjoy playing games when I have some free time, lately I've been enjoying Dota 2 and Minecraft.
