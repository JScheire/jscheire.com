                        I'm currently a sophomore at Rutgers University double majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I'm currently very passionate about data science, machine learning, and software engineering and I have recently been delving into these fields at hackathons and side projects. 
                        I am currently searching for software engineering and data science oppurtunities for the summer of 2020.

                        When I'm not programming, I am an active cellist and an avid classical music fan. I frequent many venues for classical music concerts, having been from my school's performing arts center to Carnegie Hall. 
                        Some of my favorite composers include Mahler, Rachmaninoff, and Shostakovich, to name a few. I also enjoy playing games when I have some free time, lately I've been enjoying Dota 2 and Minecraft.
