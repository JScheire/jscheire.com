                        I'm currently a sophomore at Rutgers University double majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I also work as a Consultant for the Office of Information of Technology at Rutgers and I tutor other engineering students.
                        I'm also a part of a handful of organizations on campus, some include IEEE and USACS.

                        When I'm not programming, I am an active cellist and an avid classical music fan. I frequent many venues for concerts, from my school's own performing arts center to Carnegie Hall. Here is a photo of me after enjoying some Dvorak and Ravel.
                        I also enjoy playing games when I have some free time, my favorites being Dota 2 and Minecraft.
